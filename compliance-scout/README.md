### Automated Rule Checks
```python
# Example accessibility checks
checks = [
    "missing_alt_text",
    "low_color_contrast", 
    "missing_form_labels",
    "improper_heading_structure",
    "non_descriptive_links",
    "missing_skip_links",
    "keyboard_trap_detection",
    "missing_focus_indicators"
]
```

### AI-Powered Visual Analysis
- Screenshot analysis for visual accessibility issues
- Layout and design accessibility assessment  
- Content readability evaluation
- Interactive element accessibility review

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Add your OpenAI API key and other configurations
```

3. Install WebDriver:
```bash
# For Chrome
wget https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
# Or use webdriver-manager for automatic setup
```

4. Run a quick scan:
```bash
python src/scanner.py --url https://example.com
```

5. Start the web interface:
```bash
streamlit run app.py

## 🔧 Scanner Architecture

### Scanning Process
```
URL Input → Page Load → DOM Analysis → Rule Checks → AI Analysis → Report Generation
    ↓         ↓           ↓             ↓            ↓              ↓
Target URL → Selenium → BeautifulSoup → Rule Engine → OpenAI API → JSON/HTML Report
```

### Core Components

1. **Web Crawler**: Selenium-based page loading and navigation
2. **DOM Analyzer**: BeautifulSoup for HTML structure analysis  
3. **Rule Engine**: Automated accessibility rule checking
4. **AI Analyzer**: Vision API for visual accessibility assessment
5. **Report Generator**: Comprehensive reporting with recommendations

## 📊 Report Features

### Violation Detection
- **Critical Issues**: Immediate accessibility blockers
- **Warning Issues**: Potential accessibility problems
- **Recommendations**: Best practice improvements

### Detailed Analysis
- Screenshot annotations highlighting issues
- Code snippets with problems identified
- Step-by-step remediation instructions
- Impact assessment for users with disabilities

### Compliance Scoring
```
Accessibility Score = (Total Checks - Violations) / Total Checks * 100

Score Ranges:
- 90-100%: Excellent (AAA compliance)
- 75-89%:  Good (AA compliance) 
- 60-74%:  Needs Improvement (A compliance)
- Below 60%: Poor (Non-compliant)
```

## 🎨 Web Interface

### Dashboard Features
- **Scan Overview**: Recent scans and overall scores
- **Violation Summary**: Issue breakdown by category
- **Trend Analysis**: Accessibility improvement tracking
- **Detailed Reports**: Drill-down into specific issues
- **Remediation Tracking**: Progress on fixing violations

### Scanning Workflow
1. Enter URL or upload HTML file
2. Configure scan parameters  
3. Execute comprehensive scan
4. Review results in interactive dashboard
5. Export reports in multiple formats
6. Track remediation progress

## 📈 Business Impact

- **Legal Compliance**: Reduce ADA lawsuit risk
- **Market Expansion**: Reach 15%+ more customers (disabled population)
- **SEO Benefits**: Improved search engine rankings
- **Brand Reputation**: Demonstrate commitment to inclusivity
- **Cost Savings**: Proactive fixes vs. reactive remediation

## 🔧 API Endpoints

### REST API
```python
POST /scan/url          # Scan a specific URL
GET  /scan/{scan_id}    # Get scan results
POST /scan/batch        # Batch scan multiple URLs  
GET  /reports/{scan_id} # Download detailed report
POST /webhook           # Webhook for CI/CD integration
```

### Example Usage
```python
import requests

# Start a scan
response = requests.post("/scan/url", json={
    "url": "https://example.com",
    "options": {
        "include_ai_analysis": True,
        "depth": 2,
        "wait_time": 3

    html = '<img src="test.jpg">'  # Missing alt
    violations = scanner.check_images(html)
    assert "missing_alt_text" in violations

def test_color_contrast():
    """Test color contrast analysis"""  
    css = "color: #777; background: #fff;"
    ratio = analyzer.calculate_contrast(css)
    assert ratio >= 4.5  # WCAG AA standard
```
