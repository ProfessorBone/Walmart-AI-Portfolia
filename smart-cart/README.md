3. **Recommendation Engine**: Personalized suggestions based on context
4. **Cart Management**: Add/remove items, optimize cart contents
5. **Conversation Memory**: Maintains context across interactions

### Conversation Flow
```
User Input → Intent Classification → Context Analysis → Action Execution → Response Generation
    ↓              ↓                    ↓               ↓                ↓
Natural Lang → Search/Cart/Rec → Previous Context → API Calls → Formatted Response
