## 🎯 About This Portfolio

Three production-grade AI systems demonstrating practical applications 
of LLMs, multi-agent architectures, and machine learning in retail/logistics 
contexts. Built while working full-time as an OTR driver.

**What makes this unique:** Each project addresses real operational challenges 
I've observed in Walmart's supply chain from ground level—from inventory gaps 
to customer experience friction points.

## 🚛 The Driver's Advantage

As an OTR driver at Walmart, I bring:
- **Ground-level insight** into logistics operations
- **Real-world context** for supply chain pain points
- **Translator role** between AI capabilities and warehouse floor needs

I'm building AI that works for the people using it, not just impresses in demos.
