🎯 About This Portfolio

This portfolio showcases three production-grade AI systems demonstrating real-world applications of Generative AI, multi-agent architectures, and machine learning within Walmart’s retail and logistics ecosystem.

Each system was designed and built while working full-time as a Walmart OTR driver, blending field experience with advanced AI system design.

What makes this portfolio unique:
It’s built from inside the supply chain — by someone who’s seen every mile, every dock, and every data point in motion. Each project directly addresses operational challenges I’ve encountered firsthand — from inventory forecasting and routing efficiency to accessibility compliance and customer experience.

These solutions aren’t lab experiments. They’re AI tools engineered for real work, designed to make Walmart’s operations faster, smarter, and more human-centered.

🚛 The Driver’s Advantage

As a Walmart over-the-road (OTR) driver, I operate within one of the most complex logistics systems in the world — and that experience gives me something data alone can’t provide: perspective from the inside.
	•	Operational Intelligence: I’ve lived the realities behind the data — scheduling conflicts, route variability, inventory delays, and the ripple effects of every inefficiency in motion.
	•	Human-Centered Awareness: I understand the human and logistical layers that define Walmart’s supply chain — from dispatch coordination to store-level execution.
	•	Applied AI Translator: I bridge the gap between Generative AI capability and real-world logistics — turning technical potential into tools that make drivers, dispatchers, and warehouse teams more efficient and supported.

My goal is simple but transformative:
to bring the power of Agentic and Generative AI into the hands of the people who move Walmart’s supply chain every day — building systems that think, learn, and collaborate with us.

“I don’t just drive for Walmart. I’m driving the next generation of AI that understands what it means to work at Walmart.”
