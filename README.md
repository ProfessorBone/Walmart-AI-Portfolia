## 🎯 About This Portfolio

Three production-grade AI systems demonstrating practical applications 
of LLMs, multi-agent architectures, and machine learning in retail/logistics 
contexts. Built while working full-time as an OTR driver.

**What makes this unique:** Each project addresses real operational challenges 
I've observed in Walmart's supply chain from ground level—from inventory gaps 
to customer experience friction points.

🚛 The Driver’s Advantage

As a Walmart over-the-road (OTR) driver, I operate within one of the most complex logistics systems in the world — and that experience gives me something data alone can’t provide: perspective from the inside.
	•	Operational Intelligence: I’ve lived the realities behind the data — scheduling conflicts, route variability, inventory delays, and the ripple effects of every inefficiency in motion.
	•	Human-Centered Awareness: I understand the human and logistical layers that define Walmart’s supply chain — from dispatch coordination to store-level execution.
	•	Applied AI Translator: I bridge the gap between Generative AI capability and real-world logistics — turning technical potential into tools that make drivers, dispatchers, and warehouse teams more efficient and supported.

My goal is simple but transformative:
to bring the power of Agentic and Generative AI into the hands of the people who move Walmart’s supply chain every day — building systems that think, learn, and collaborate with us.

“I don’t just drive for Walmart. I’m driving the next generation of AI that understands what it means to work at Walmart.”
