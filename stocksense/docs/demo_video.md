## üìù Narration Script

### Opening
"Welcome to StockSense, an AI-powered inventory intelligence system that predicts stockouts before they happen. In retail, stockouts cost companies billions in lost sales and customer dissatisfaction. Let me show you how StockSense solves this problem."

### Data Section
"We're working with a dataset of 1000 products across 8 major categories. Each product has current inventory levels, historical sales data, and supplier information. Our system analyzes this data in real-time to identify potential stockout risks."

### Prediction Section
"The heart of StockSense is our machine learning model. It considers over 20 factors including current stock levels, demand patterns, supplier lead times, and seasonal trends. As you can see, it has identified 47 products at high risk of stockout."

### Dashboard Section
"The interactive dashboard makes it easy for inventory managers to act on these insights. Products are color-coded by risk level, and each comes with specific recommendations. For example, this electronics item needs immediate reordering because current stock will only last 0.7 days."

### Impact Section
"The business impact is significant. Our pilot implementation showed a 35% reduction in stockouts and over $2 million in annual savings through optimized inventory levels."
