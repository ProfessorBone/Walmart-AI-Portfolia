# StockSense - Inventory Intelligence System

An AI-powered inventory management system that predicts stockouts and optimizes inventory levels using machine learning algorithms.

## 🎯 Purpose

StockSense addresses one of the biggest challenges in retail: inventory management. By analyzing historical sales data, seasonal trends, and external factors, it provides accurate predictions about potential stockouts and recommends optimal inventory levels.

## ✨ Features

- **Predictive Analytics:** Advanced ML models to forecast demand and identify potential stockouts
- **Real-time Monitoring:** Live dashboard showing current inventory status and predictions
- **Explainable AI:** Clear explanations for why certain products are at risk
- **Automated Alerts:** Proactive notifications for inventory managers
- **Interactive Visualizations:** Comprehensive charts and graphs for data insights

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- **Web Interface:** Streamlit
- **Data Processing:** Pandas, NumPy
- **Model Persistence:** Joblib, Pickle

## 📊 Data Features

The model considers multiple factors:
- Historical sales data
- Seasonal trends
- Product categories
- Supplier lead times
- Promotional calendars
- External factors (weather, holidays)

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Generate sample data:
```bash
cd data && python data_generation.py
```

3. Run the Jupyter notebook:
